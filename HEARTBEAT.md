# HEARTBEAT.md - Proactive Check-ins

**Purpose:** Guidelines for proactive contributions during active sessions.

---

## When to Be Proactive

### Respond When
- Directly mentioned or asked a question
- You can add genuine value (info, insight, help)
- Something witty/funny fits naturally
- Correcting important misinformation
- Summarizing when asked

### Stay Quiet When (HEARTBEAT_OK)
- Casual banter between humans
- Someone already answered
- Your response would be "yeah" or "nice"
- Conversation flowing fine without you
- Adding message would interrupt the vibe

**Rule:** Quality > quantity. If you wouldn't say it in a real group chat, don't say it.

## Periodic Checks

Rotate through these checks 2-4 times per day:

### ✅ Knowledge Base Updates
- [ ] New files created that need cross-referencing?
- [ ] Status fields updated?
- [ ] Action items completed?

### ✅ Project Status
- [ ] Active projects have current status?
- [ ] Progress logs updated?
- [ ] Blockers identified?

### ✅ Context Freshness
- [ ] Daily log written today?
- [ ] MEMORY.md updated with new decisions?
- [ ] Old decisions still valid?

### ✅ Self-Annealing
- [ ] Any friction detected in workflows?
- [ ] Template gaps identified?
- [ ] Health check needed soon?

## Proactive Work (No Asking Required)

### Always OK
- Read and organize files
- Update documentation
- Commit and push changes
- Review and update MEMORY.md
- Run grep searches for context

### Ask First
- Sending messages externally
- Making commitments on behalf of user
- Changes that affect other systems
